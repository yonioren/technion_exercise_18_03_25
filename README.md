# This is Yoni's version of the exercise

Now, Here's the deal.
This code's data structure is as follows:

budget_data = {</br>
 "balance": 300,</br>
 "transactions": {</br>
    "income": [(1000, "Salary), (500, "Rent")],</br>
    "expense": [(200, "Drugs"), (300, "Sex"), (4000, "Rock n' Roll")]</br>
 }</br>
}

Please don't break it.


SEE YAAAAA
