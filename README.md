# This is Yoni's version of the exercise

Now, Here's the deal.
This code's data structure is as follows:

budget_data = {
 "balance": 300,
 "transactions": {
    "income": [(1000, "Salary), (500, "Rent")],
    "expense": [(200, "Drugs"), (300, "Sex"), (4000, "Rock n' Roll")]
 }
}

Please don't break it.


SEE YAAAAA
